Signaturit Ruby SDK
===================

This package is a wrapper for Signaturit Api. If you didn't read the documentation yet, maybe it's time to take a look [here](https://docs.signaturit.com/).

You can install the package through gem.

```
gem install signaturit-sdk
```

Configuration
-------------

Just import the Signaturit Client this way

```
require 'signaturit_client'
```

Then you can authenticate yourself using your AuthToken

```
client = SignaturitClient.new('TOKEN')
```

Remember, the default calls are made to our Sandbox server. If you want to do in production, just set the flag when you do the call.

```
client = SignaturitClient.new('TOKEN', true)
```
